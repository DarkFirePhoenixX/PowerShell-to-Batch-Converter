# PowerShell-To-Batch-Converter
 Small script to convert powershell to batch files allowing you to execute your scripts without enabling "running scripts" on Windows.

 There are two versions: one Batch & one PowerShell one.

 If you have scripts disabled on your system you might want to use the converted Batch one.

 The script usage is as simple as it can get. Just open the file and a file selection dialog will show up. There you can choose your file you wish to convert,
 click OK and let the magic happen.

 Enjoy :D
